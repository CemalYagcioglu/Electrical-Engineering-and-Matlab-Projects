\section{Palm Figure 6.1-2}
% Use the code \cite[p.~265]{Palm} somewhere in a line or two about
% how you made the figure
I gave x equally spaced values between 0 and 4 by using linspace code. Then I graphed \begin{align} y=x^m \end{align} (\cite[p.~265]{Palm} for different values of m(-0.5,0,0.5,1,2). I labeled each curve for different values of m with the m value, and gave title to the plot.


\section{Chapra Problem 3.5}
% Compare and contrast the different ways this program worked with angles.
For the Chapra Problem 3.5, my program worked with different values of angle. With increasing number of N(number of steps used in Taylor Series), the accuracy for the given angle increased. On the other hand, with increasing angles, the accuracy of approximations decreased meaning the error increased. Even if the angles are actually are same, meaning two pi subtracted from the angle is same, bigger corresponding angle gave a higher error.
\section{Chapra Problem 4.1}
% Introduction to the table, including a citation, here,
Table of Maclaurin series \cite[p.~120]{Chapra} is; 
% followed by
\begin{center}
{\tt
\input{DivAvgTable.tex}
}
\end{center}
% Followed by commentary here about the relative quality of the approximations
The quality of approximations increases as the iteration number increase. For the given iteration number, smaller values of \textit{a} have higher quality of approximations. This can also be observed from increasing number of iterations as \textit{a} increases. While for small values of \textit{a} expected accuracy can be reached before iterations have reached to their maximum value, for higher values of \textit{a} iterations reaches the maxvalue before they can reach to expected accuracy.

% by those scripts.

% Put a \pagebreak after all the scripts/functions
